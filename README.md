# Custom Programming Language Project

## Overview

In this group project, we designed the syntax of our own custom programming language and implemented a translator to an existing language of our choice. The core of this implementation involves building and traversing an Abstract Syntax Tree (AST).

Our goal was to:

* Design and define a formal grammar for our new language
* Make intentional language design choices based on course concepts
* Implement a translator that converts code in our custom language into valid source code of an existing language (e.g., Java or Python)
* Demonstrate all required language features through example code

---

## Requirements & Deliverables

To complete the project, we delivered the following:

1. **Formal Language Definition**
   Parsing rules for all language components that cover the specified feature set.

2. **Language Design Explanation**
   Justification of design decisions based on the "Building Blocks" portion of the course. This includes:

   * Syntax and structural choices
   * Typing system (e.g., dynamic vs static)
   * Translation target (e.g., Java, Python) and rationale

3. **Example Program**
   A code sample written in our language demonstrating the required language features.

4. **Implementation Code**
   All source code required to parse, translate, and execute our custom language using an AST-based translator.

5. **Presentation & Demo**
   Live demonstration of parsing, translation, and execution of our example program.

## Coverage Requirements

Our custom language supports the following features:

* ✅ String literals
* ✅ Equality comparison on strings
* ✅ Variable declarations and assignments
* ✅ `if-then-else` conditional statements
* ✅ Loops (at least one type)
* ✅ `print` statements

---

## Tools & Resources

* Language translation implemented via a custom parser and AST generator
* Target language: **\[Java / Python / other – specify]**
* External tools used (if any): e.g., JavaCC, ANTLR, or custom-built parser
* Course material and additional internet research were used; references are cited where appropriate
rom external sources or other groups will result in a **grade of 0** for the entire project.
